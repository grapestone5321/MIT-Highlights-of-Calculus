## Course Description

Highlights of Calculus is a series of short videos that introduces the basics of calculus—how it works and why it is important. 

The intended audience is high school students, college students, or anyone who might need help understanding the subject.

The series is divided into three sections:

### Introduction

- Why Professor Strang created these videos

- How to use the materials

### Highlights of Calculus

- Five videos reviewing the key topics and ideas of calculus

- Applications to real-life situations and problems

- Additional summary slides and practice problems

### Derivatives

- Twelve videos focused on differential calculus

- More applications to real-life situations and problems

- Additional summary slides and practice problems

Professor Gilbert Strang is a renowned mathematics professor who has taught at MIT since 1962. Read more about Prof. Strang.

Special thanks to Professor J.C. Nave for his help and advice on the development and recording of this program.




## Introduction: Gil Strang's Introduction to Calculus for Highlights for High School

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&v=X9t-u87df3o

Gil Strang gives an overview of his video series Calculus for MIT's Highlights for High School program. 

Designed to give an easier introduction to calculus.


Professor Gilbert Strang talks informally in his office at MIT about why he created this video series, and how MIT OpenCourseWare users can benefit from these materials.

Professor Strang's Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available here.

Subtitles are provided through the generous assistance of Jimmy Ren.


## Highlights of Calculus (5 videos)

These five Highlights of Calculus videos provide an overview of the key topics and ideas of calculus and how they apply to real-life situations and problems. 

In addition to the videos, there are summary slides and practice problems complete with an audio narration by Professor Strang. 

You can find these files under the Related Resources tab on each video page.

### 1. Big Picture of Calculus

Calculus is about change. One function tells how quickly another function is changing. 

Professor Strang shows how calculus applies to ordinary life situations, such as:

* driving a car
* climbing a mountain
* growing to full adult height

### 2. Big Picture: Derivatives

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_I-CUOc_bk&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=3

Calculus finds the relationship between the distance traveled and the speed — easy for constant speed, not so easy for changing speed. 

Professor Strang is finding the "rate of change" and the "slope of a curve" and the "derivative of a function."

### 3. Max and Min and Second Derivative

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBBJ2TSTa1Q&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=4

At the top and bottom of a curve (Max and Min), the slope is zero. The "second derivative" shows whether the curve is bending down or up. 

Here is a real-world example of a minimum problem:

What route from home to work takes the shortest time?


### 4. The Exponential Function

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo1ZZlvT2LQ&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=5

Professor Strang explains how the "magic number e" connects to ordinary things like the interest on a bank account. 

The graph of
y = ex has the special property that its slope equals its height (it goes up "exponentially fast"!). 

This is the great function of calculus.

### 5. Big Picture: Integrals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qxY859dzzQ&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=6

The second half of calculus looks for the distance traveled even when the speed is changing. 

Finding this "integral" is the opposite of finding the derivative. 

Professor Strang explains how the integral adds up little pieces to recover the total distance.

I know the speed at each moment of my trip, so how far did I go?

## Derivatives (12 videos)

These twelve videos on Derivatives dig deeper into the subfield of calculus known as "differential calculus."  

Like the overview videos, Professor Strang explains how each topic applies to real-life applications.  

Along with the videos, there are summary slides and practice problems available under the Related Resources tab on each video page.

### 1. Derivative of sin x and cos x

### 2. Product Rule and Quotient Rule

### 3. Chains f(g(x)) and the Chain Rule

### 4. Limits and Continuous Functions

### 5. Inverse Functions f ^-1 (y) and the Logarithm x = ln y

### 6. Derivatives of ln y and sin ^-1 (y)

### 7. Growth Rate and Log Graphs

### 8. Linear Approximation/Newton's Method

### 9. Power Series/Euler's Great Formula

### 10. Differential Equations of Motion

### 11. Differential Equations of Growth

### 12. Six Functions, Six Rules, and Six Theorems
