## Course Description

Highlights of Calculus is a series of short videos that introduces the basics of calculusâ€”how it works and why it is important. 

The intended audience is high school students, college students, or anyone who might need help understanding the subject.

The series is divided into three sections:

### Introduction

- Why Professor Strang created these videos

- How to use the materials

### Highlights of Calculus

- Five videos reviewing the key topics and ideas of calculus

- Applications to real-life situations and problems

- Additional summary slides and practice problems

### Derivatives

- Twelve videos focused on differential calculus

- More applications to real-life situations and problems

- Additional summary slides and practice problems

Professor Gilbert Strang is a renowned mathematics professor who has taught at MIT since 1962. Read more about Prof. Strang.

Special thanks to Professor J.C. Nave for his help and advice on the development and recording of this program.




## Introduction: Gil Strang's Introduction to Calculus for Highlights for High School

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&v=X9t-u87df3o

Gil Strang gives an overview of his video series Calculus for MIT's Highlights for High School program. 

Designed to give an easier introduction to calculus.


Professor Gilbert Strang talks informally in his office at MIT about why he created this video series, and how MIT OpenCourseWare users can benefit from these materials.

Professor Strang's Calculus textbook (1st edition, 1991) is freely available here.

Subtitles are provided through the generous assistance of Jimmy Ren.


## Highlights of Calculus (5 videos)

These five Highlights of Calculus videos provide an overview of the key topics and ideas of calculus and how they apply to real-life situations and problems. 

In addition to the videos, there are summary slides and practice problems complete with an audio narration by Professor Strang. 

You can find these files under the Related Resources tab on each video page.

### Derivatives (12 videos)

These twelve videos on Derivatives dig deeper into the subfield of calculus known as "differential calculus."  

Like the overview videos, Professor Strang explains how each topic applies to real-life applications.  

Along with the videos, there are summary slides and practice problems available under the Related Resources tab on each video page.
